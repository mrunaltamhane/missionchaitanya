            What is life? What is birth and death? Why does one suffer while
            another experiences joy? Is this the only birth? These are some of
            the fundamental questions that every thinking individual seeks an
            answer to. There is much confusion, scepticism or disbelief even
            amongst practising Hindus.

            <br />
            Every individual has a gross body which is perceived and a subtle
            body which cannot be perceived. The gross body is made up of the
            five gross elements (space, air, fire, water and earth), is born
            from the mother's womb and is the counter of all experiences of
            life. It grows, decays, and finally perishes at death. It is buried
            or burnt by others and returns to the elements of which it is
            composed.The subtle body is made up of the five subtle elements, It
            consists of the five sense organs (ability to hear, feel, see, taste
            and smell), the five organs of action (ability to speak, grasp,
            move, excrete and procreate), the five physiological functions
            (breathing, excretion, circulation, ejection and digestion) and
            four-fold inner equipment (mind, intellect, memory and the I-notion
            or ego).

            Within, yet beyond the two bodies, is the pure, infinite Self (Atma)
            which is neither born nor dies, It is also called Truth (Satyam),
            Reality (Brahman) or Consciousness (Caitanya) in philosophy and God
            (Isvara) in religion.

            <br />
            Life (jÄ«vanam) is the manifestation of Consciousness /Self in the
            gross body through the medium of the subtle body. Let us take the
            analogy of a light bulb. The light (life) is the manifestation of
            electricity (Self) in the bulb (gross body) through the medium of
            the filament (subtle body). Whenever there is light (life) there
            must be electricity (Consciousness/Self). But wherever there is
            electricity (Consciousness/Self) there need not be light (life). The
            stone has Consciousness/Self/ God but no life, since it does not
            have a subtle body which alone can manifest life.
            <br />A being with a more developed subtle body is considered higher
            in the ladder of evolution. The amoeba is thus amongst the lowest of
            life forms and the human being amongst the highest.

            </u>
            <br />
            The body is ever changing and perishing. The Consciousness/Self is
            unchanging and immortal. Connecting these two is the sentient ego,
            the individual which borrows its sentiency from the Self and
            identifies with the name, form and qualities of the two bodies. It
            owns the two bodies (I am fat, I am glad...), their actions (I sing,
            I think...) and the results reaped thereof (I enjoy, I suffer...).
            It goes through the three states of experience (I am awake, I dream
            and I sleep). It is this individuality alone that goes through the
            experience of birth and death (today is my birthday, I shall die one
            day...).

            It is commonly accepted that the emergence of the child from the
            womb is its birth and that the ebbing away of life represents the
            death of a person. However in the light of what has been said
            earlier, birth is the entry of the subtle body into the gross body
            along with the individuality (jiva) that owns both. Some say that
            the individual enters at conception and some that it enters a few
            months later. <br />
            However it is commonly believed that the foetus in the womb is
            alive. Death is the departure of the individual from the gross body.
            The presence of the subtle body alone is the indicator of life in
            the body.

              In conclusion, Hindus are not idol worshippers. The idol
              represents the ideal (God) to be worshipped. Thus the infinite and
              all-pervading God can also be worshipped in the idol with
              offerings.
