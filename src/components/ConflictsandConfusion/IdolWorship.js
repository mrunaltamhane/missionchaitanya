            A common allegation made against the Hindus is that they are idol
            worshippers. Are Hindus idol worshippers?
            <br />
            <u>The Ideal and the Idol</u>
            <br />
            No, Hindus do not worship idols. They worship the ideal (God)
            represented by the idol. The Siva-linge is the symbol (linga) of
            Siva. When I salute the flag of my country, do I salute a stick and
            cloth or the ideals of my country represented by the stick and the
            cloth?

            The Christians pray before the cross and the statues of Mary and
            Jesus, the Muslims turn towards the Kaba, the Sikhs worship the Guru
            Granth Sahib their holy book, and the Zoroastrians worship fire. Are
            they all idol worshippers? All flags have symbolic meanings.
            Similarly all forms of God havesymbolic meanings. For example the
            conch, disc, mace and lotus in the hands of Visnu represent the four
            goals of dharma, wealth, pleasure and liberation that the Lord
            bestows on His devotees.

            God is infinite and formless in His true nature. He manifests as the
            whole creation (all forms), incarnates in special forms (Śrī Rāma,
            Śrī Kṛṣṇa) and assumes many more forms (Durga, Śiva, Gaṇeśa). He can
            therefore be invoked in any external form - stone, wood, tree, fire,
            sun, idol, picture, or within us as the divine Self.

            <b>Why do we need idols?</b> <br /> <br /> Why worship God in idols?
            Some keep the photograph of their beloved son in various stages of
            his life, in different rooms at home and even on their office table.
            The photograph reminds them of him. evokes love and gives solace in
            moments of loneliness. Even when one kisses the glass photo-frame,
            one feels one is kissing the child. <br />
            Similarly the idol, picture or symbol of the Lord reminds the
            devotee of His qualities and sports,elevates his mind and fills him
            with devotion. The idol provides the focus by which the devotee can
            direct his prayers and worship, express his feelings and feel His
            presence.

            <b>Is God in idols?</b> <br /> <br /> God is everywhere. Of course
            He is in the idol bur not just only in the idol. He cannot be
            limited, for He is omnipresent. The devotee initially invokes His
            presence in the idol. With regular worship his mind gets uplifted
            and he is able to see Him everywhere. Saint Ekanatha was carrying
            the holy Ganga water from Prayaga in North India to worship Lord
            Rameshwar in a temple in South India. Seeing the Lord in a thirsty
            donkey he gave away the precious water to him. A Siva-linga is said
            to have appeared at that spot. <br />

              <b>How is God worshipped through idols?</b> <br /> <br /> In India
              a guest is honoured and considered as God and God is worshipped in
              an idol as an honoured and revered guest. The altar is decorated
              beautifully. He is invoked in the idol, His feet are washed, He is
              offered sandal paste, holy rice, flowers, food, incense, arati
              (vesper light)... - the best of all we have with a reverential and
              humble attitude. If a person feeds a stray dog daily he starts
              loving it. Will devotion not arise if we feed God with love and
              reverence?

              In conclusion, Hindus are not idol worshippers. The idol
              represents the ideal (God) to be worshipped. Thus the infinite and
              all-pervading God can also be worshipped in the idol with
              offerings.
