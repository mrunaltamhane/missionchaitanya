            In most temples, there are one or more bells Inung from the top,
            near the entrance. The devotee rings the bell as soon as he enters,
            thereafter proceeding for darśana of the Lord and prayers. Children
            love jumping up or being carried high to reach the bell.

            Why do we ring the bell?
            <br />
            Is it to wake up the Lord? But the Lord never sleeps. Is it to let
            the Lord know we have come? He does not need to be told, as He is
            all knowing. Is it a form of seeking permission to enter His
            precinct? Since the temple is like a homecoming no permission for
            entering is needed. The Lord welcomes us at all times. Then why do
            we ring the bell?
          </p>

          <p>
            The ringing of the bell produces an auspicious sound. There should
            be auspiciousness within and without, to gain the vision of the
            Lord, who is all auspiciousness. The ringing produces the sound
            'Om', which is the universal name of the Lord.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even while doing the ritualistic arati, we ring the bell. It is
            sometimes accompanied by the auspicious sounds of the conch and
            other musical instruments. An added significance of ringing the
            bell, conch and other instruments is that they help drown any
            inauspicious or irrelevant noises and comments that might disturb or
            distract the worshippers in their devotional ardour, concentration
            and inner peace.

            As we start the daily ritualistic worship (pūjā) we ring the bell,
            chanting -
            <br />
            <b>
              {" "}
              आगमार्थं तु देवानां गमनार्थं तु रक्षसाम् । कुर्वे घण्टारवं तत्र
              देवताद्द्वान लक्षणम् ॥{" "}
            </b>
            <br />
            <br /> agamartham tu devānāṁ gamanärtham tu rakṣasām,
            <br />
            kurve ghanta-ravam tatra devatähvāna lakṣaṇam.
            <br />
            <br />I ring this bell indicating the invocation of divinity, so
            that virtuous and noble forces enter (my home and heart); and the
            demonic and evil forces from within and without, depart.
